I used C# to code this program.

# Future Work

These are things I would like to do in the future with this code. 

- I would like to add files where we can save the recipe for later use.
- I would also like to refine the search system so it ran faster, by perhaps adding threads or something.
- I would like to add and save an image to go with the meal. 
- I would also like to add some filter functions
